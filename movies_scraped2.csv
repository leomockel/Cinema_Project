The only French-speaking community of Dominican nuns in North America for nearly a century, the nuns of Berthierville (in province of Quebec, Canada) are engaged in a rare and unique documentary in which exceptional testimonies and archives are intertwined. It is a spiritual journey into the intimacy of the monastery to which you are invited. The encounter and living witness of faith and humanity of these consecrated women, descendants of more than eight hundred years of history, is carried out in a singular way. One by one, they entrust the camera with the hope that inhabits their existential journey. And throughout the four seasons, we discover the magnificent monastery full of grace with its immense magnificent gardens.;;;
